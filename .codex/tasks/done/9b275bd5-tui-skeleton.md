# Build Textual app skeleton

- Refactor existing `LabelingApp` into a multi-screen Textual application with navigation (capture, whitelist, config, training status).
- Ensure global key bindings or menu allow switching screens and exiting the app.
- Wire the YOLO training scheduler to run in the background and expose a manual retrain action.
- Reference: `.codex/planning/plan.md`, `.codex/planning/textual_review.md`.
