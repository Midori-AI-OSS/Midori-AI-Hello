# Copilot Instructions for Midori-AI-Hello

This repository is a simple starter project. Source documentation and tasks live under `.codex/`.

## Key Practices
- Use `uv` for Python execution and dependency management.
- Keep docs up to date in `.codex/implementation/` when code changes occur.
- Check `.codex/tasks/` for open work and move finished items to `tasks/done/`.
- Follow commit style `[TYPE] Title` and run tests with `pytest`.
